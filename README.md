**DriftAware-SIAlt** is a python toolbox to generate drift-aware trajectories from along-track sea ice freeboard and thickness estimates derived from satellite altimetry. Daily collections of drift-aware trajectories are saved as csv files. In the second step, drift-corrected positions of sea ice parcels are gridded and saved as daily NetCDF files. The repository also provides tools for visualisation.
